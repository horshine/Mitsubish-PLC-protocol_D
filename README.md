Mitsubish-PLC
=============
this project represent how to use serial to communicate with Mitsubishi PLC 

the project is developed  on  VC6.0 IDE. which maybe not compatible with VS 2005 or upper  IDE tools .  i suggest you take used  VC6.0 to run the project . 

if you just interested at the protocol of mitsubishi  serial communication , you could pick the PLC_Dapk.cpp and PLC_Dapk.h file 

it was an old project which when i started my development career . 
not perfect , but works , i hope this project could help those who wanna communicate with Mitsubishi PLC
